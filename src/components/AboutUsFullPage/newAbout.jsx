//                     by an aim to disrupt the status quo in the future of marketing! 
//                     Our founder's journey goes back to 20XX, while he was still in 
//                     college, promoting and marketing events and concerts in Indore.
//                     He was training his juniors and working with them all the same 
//                     to attain experience. <br/>

//                     In his final year, Yash had IIM calls as well as placement offers
//                     in several top notch companies across the country but he'd rather 
//                     hustle to make his dream work than punch clock for someone else's.
//                     The paucity of funds resulted him in taking up a temporary job in 
//                     Indore to provide for his startup. Our now COO joined him around 
//                     that time as an intern.
